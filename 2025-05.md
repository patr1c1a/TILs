### String formatting and interpolation in Csharp

_Tags: #CSharp #strings_

String concatenation can be better replaced by string formatting or interpolation.

```csharp
string customerInfo = "Customer Name: " + customer.FirstName + " " + customer.LastName + ", Address: " + customer.Address.Street + ", " + customer.Address.City + ", " + customer.Address.State + " " + customer.Address.Zip + ", Phone: " + customer.PhoneNumber + ", Email: " + customer.Email;
```

Can be replaced by a more readable version using string.Format:

```csharp
string customerInfo = string.Format("Customer Name: {0} {1}, Address: {2}, {3}, {4} {5}, Phone: {6}, Email: {7}",
    customer.FirstName, 
    customer.LastName, 
    customer.Address.Street, 
    customer.Address.City, 
    customer.Address.State, 
    customer.Address.Zip, 
    customer.PhoneNumber, 
    customer.Email);
```

Or using string interpolation (C# 6+)

```csharp
string customerInfo = $"Customer Name: {customer.FirstName} {customer.LastName}, Address: {customer.Address.Street}, {customer.Address.City}, {customer.Address.State} {customer.Address.Zip}, Phone: {customer.PhoneNumber}, Email: {customer.Email}";
```

### Deleting a column from a table

_Tags: #SQLServer_

This is probably something more related to "working smarter" than about a technology, but it happened to me: I had to replace a SQL Server table column in a .net application with NHibernate, and the old column would become obsolete after the whole refactor was done. So I needed to make sure it was safe to remove the column before actually doing it. The NHibernate mapping already had the new column and the old one wasn't even mentioned there. But the old property (related to that column) was still present in the model (annotated to be deleted once the refactor was complete). So the "trick" was to remove that property, build the code and see where it was throwing errors.
