### Git Patch for Sharing Changes
_Tags: #Git #VersionControl #SharingChanges_

Git Patch can be used to share uncommited changes with someone. It can be an easy way to do it when you don't want to commit and push changes to the remote repository. E.g.: you have a local branch where you're testing something and don't want to push it to the remote, but you need to share the changes with someone else. It makes more sense when there are multiple files with changes (otherwise it's easier to just copy/paste).

`git diff > mypatch.patch` generates a file in the root folder of the project. Send this file to whoever you want (using whatever method you want) and they should do `git apply /path/to/mypatch.patch`.

You can view the contents of the patch file with just a text editor.

If you use `git diff > mypatch.patch`, unstaged changes are not included.

### NUnit, NSubstitute, and XUnit

_Tags: #NUnit #NSubstitute #XUnit #UnitTesting_

The NUnit framework for unit tests doesn't provide mocking functionality. NSubstitute allows to mock by using "Fakes". XUnit is another option for unit testing, which allows parallel execution of tests.

To use NSubstitute for mocking purposes, you need to create the mocked object using `var myMock = Substitute.For<Class_or_Interface>();` and then use this mock by doing `myMock.someMethodFromMockedClass().Returns(whateverYouWant);`

### How to think in TDD terms

_Tags: #TDD #UnitTesting_

When using Test Driven Development, it's ok if you have no clue of what the code will look like at first. You probably will have to refactor your initial code, so with tests it's the same. You go ahead and write a test for whatever requirements you have on the high level, and then try to write code that implements the functionality. As you change the structure of your code, you'll change your tests. Always remember to change tests first.

### C#: Static vs Abstract classes

_Tags: #Csharp #oop_

C# has both static and abstract classes. Neither can be instantiated but static classes can't be inherited from (they don't have a constructor) while the purpose of abstract classes is to be used as base classes.

Static classes are intended to group common utility, constants and behavior that don't require any state. They're good to include helper methods that don't require an instance. Like the Math class that provides mathematical functions and constants.
