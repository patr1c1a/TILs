### Git Patch for Sharing Changes

_Tags: #Git #VersionControl #SharingChanges_

Git Patch can be used to share uncommited changes with someone. It can be an easy way to do it when you don't want to commit and push changes to the remote repository. E.g.: you have a local branch where you're testing something and don't want to push it to the remote, but you need to share the changes with someone else. It makes more sense when there are multiple files with changes (otherwise it's easier to just copy/paste).

`git diff > mypatch.patch` generates a file in the root folder of the project. Send this file to whoever you want (using whatever method you want) and they should do `git apply /path/to/mypatch.patch`.

You can view the contents of the patch file with just a text editor.

If you use `git diff > mypatch.patch`, unstaged changes are not included.

### NUnit, NSubstitute, and XUnit

_Tags: #NUnit #NSubstitute #XUnit #UnitTesting_

The NUnit framework for unit tests doesn't provide mocking functionality. NSubstitute allows to mock by using "Fakes". XUnit is another option for unit testing, which allows parallel execution of tests.

To use NSubstitute for mocking purposes, you need to create the mocked object using `var myMock = Substitute.For<Class_or_Interface>();` and then use this mock by doing `myMock.someMethodFromMockedClass().Returns(whateverYouWant);`

### How to think in TDD terms

_Tags: #TDD #UnitTesting_

When using Test Driven Development, it's ok if you have no clue of what the code will look like at first. You probably will have to refactor your initial code, so with tests it's the same. You go ahead and write a test for whatever requirements you have on the high level, and then try to write code that implements the functionality. As you change the structure of your code, you'll change your tests. Always remember to change tests first.

### C#: Static vs Abstract classes

_Tags: #Csharp #oop_

C# has both static and abstract classes. Neither can be instantiated but static classes can't be inherited from (they don't have a constructor) while the purpose of abstract classes is to be used as base classes.

Static classes are intended to group common utility, constants and behavior that don't require any state. They're good to include helper methods that don't require an instance. Like the Math class that provides mathematical functions and constants.

### C#: "new" keyword can be used to hide a method

_Tags: #Csharp #oop_

When a method in a derived class is declared with the "new" keyword, it's hiding the method and using a method with the same name in the base class. It can be used to avoid unintended overrides.

```csharp
class BaseClass
{
    public int SomeMethod()
    {
        return 10;
    }
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    public new int SomeMethod()
    {
        return 20;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        BaseClass obj = new DerivedClass();
        Console.WriteLine(obj.SomeMethod()); // Outputs 10, not 20
    }
}
```

### C#: "event" keyword

_Tags: #Csharp #oop #pattern_

The "event" keyword can be used to declare an event in a class or an interface and it allows an object to notify other objects when something happens. Events are used to implement the observer pattern.

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public event EventHandler MyEvent;
}
```

The EventHandler type represents methods that take two parameters: an object sender and an EventArgs object. Objects interested in being notified when the event occurs can subscribe to it.

```csharp
public class Subscriber
{
    public void MyEventHandler(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Handle the event
    }
}

MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
Subscriber subscriber = new Subscriber();

// Subscribe to the event
myObject.MyEvent += subscriber.MyEventHandler;

// Unsubscribe from the event
myObject.MyEvent -= subscriber.MyEventHandler;
```

### C#: verbatim strings

_Tags: #Csharp #strings_

The @ character causes escaped sequences to be interpreted literally (e.g.: `\\` for a backslash).

## 13

### ESLint

_Tags: #lint #eslint #guidelines_

The ESLint static code analysis tool allows to load specific style guides used by popular companies (Google, Airbnb, etc.), so we can write code following their guidelines.

## 14

### IIS bindings

_Tags: #iis #microsoft_

IIS (Internet Information Services) has a "site bindings" dialog that can be used to define the combination of IP address, port, and host header used to route incoming requests to the correct website.

### Webdriver manager for Selenium

_Tags: #selenium #automation #python_

When using Python and Selenium there's a package called webdriver-manager (also available for Java, JavaScript, Python, C# and Ruby) that automatically downloads and installs the appropriate webdriver. This replaces the need to manually download the binary files and add them to the path environment variable, with the added need of maintenance every time the browser versions change. 

To use this, we can import ChromeDriverManager, GeckoDriverManager, EdgeChromiumDriverManager, etc. from webdriver_manager.chrome, webdriver_manager.firefox or webdriver_manager.microsoft and then use it for each browser like this: `webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))`.

### Visual Studio - Add a script as "external tool"

_Tags: #VisualStudio #batch_

We can add a batch file with whatever script we want to run, and it will be added as an item to the "Tools" menu in Visual Studio. This can be set up by going to `Tools > External Tools > Add` and then in the "Command" field select the *.bat file. Any arguments can be added in the "Arguments" field (e.g.: if the script expects the working directory -the location of the Git repository- as a parameter, then "Solution Directory" should be selected).

### Python list sorting with a key

_Tags: #Python #sort #algorithms_

When sorting a list in Python there are 2 options: some_list.sort(), which sorts some_list in place and it's a bit more efficient, or sorted(some_iterable) which creates a new and sorted list from any iterable. By default they sort in ascending order. And both have a "key" parameter that can be assigned any function to be executed on each element before making the comparison. So, for example, given a list of strings called "words", `words.sort(key=len)` will sort the list by string length, from shorter to longer.

### Semantic versioning

_Tags: #versioning_

The usual method of software versioning, which is `major.minor.patch` (although there are others),  is called "semantic versioning". [There is also a specification for it](https://semver.org).
