### Git Patch for Sharing Changes

_Tags: #Git #VersionControl #SharingChanges_

Git Patch can be used to share uncommited changes with someone. It can be an easy way to do it when you don't want to commit and push changes to the remote repository. E.g.: you have a local branch where you're testing something and don't want to push it to the remote, but you need to share the changes with someone else. It makes more sense when there are multiple files with changes (otherwise it's easier to just copy/paste).

`git diff > mypatch.patch` generates a file in the root folder of the project. Send this file to whoever you want (using whatever method you want) and they should do `git apply /path/to/mypatch.patch`.

You can view the contents of the patch file with just a text editor.

If you use `git diff > mypatch.patch`, unstaged changes are not included.

### NUnit, NSubstitute, and XUnit

_Tags: #NUnit #NSubstitute #XUnit #UnitTesting_

The NUnit framework for unit tests doesn't provide mocking functionality. NSubstitute allows to mock by using "Fakes". XUnit is another option for unit testing, which allows parallel execution of tests.

To use NSubstitute for mocking purposes, you need to create the mocked object using `var myMock = Substitute.For<Class_or_Interface>();` and then use this mock by doing `myMock.someMethodFromMockedClass().Returns(whateverYouWant);`

### How to think in TDD terms

_Tags: #TDD #UnitTesting_

When using Test Driven Development, it's ok if you have no clue of what the code will look like at first. You probably will have to refactor your initial code, so with tests it's the same. You go ahead and write a test for whatever requirements you have on the high level, and then try to write code that implements the functionality. As you change the structure of your code, you'll change your tests. Always remember to change tests first.

### C#: Static vs Abstract classes

_Tags: #Csharp #oop_

C# has both static and abstract classes. Neither can be instantiated but static classes can't be inherited from (they don't have a constructor) while the purpose of abstract classes is to be used as base classes.

Static classes are intended to group common utility, constants and behavior that don't require any state. They're good to include helper methods that don't require an instance. Like the Math class that provides mathematical functions and constants.

### C#: "new" keyword can be used to hide a method

_Tags: #Csharp #oop_

When a method in a derived class is declared with the "new" keyword, it's hiding the method and using a method with the same name in the base class. It can be used to avoid unintended overrides.

```csharp
class BaseClass
{
    public int SomeMethod()
    {
        return 10;
    }
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    public new int SomeMethod()
    {
        return 20;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        BaseClass obj = new DerivedClass();
        Console.WriteLine(obj.SomeMethod()); // Outputs 10, not 20
    }
}
```

### C#: "event" keyword

_Tags: #Csharp #oop #pattern_

The "event" keyword can be used to declare an event in a class or an interface and it allows an object to notify other objects when something happens. Events are used to implement the observer pattern.

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public event EventHandler MyEvent;
}
```

The EventHandler type represents methods that take two parameters: an object sender and an EventArgs object. Objects interested in being notified when the event occurs can subscribe to it.

```csharp
public class Subscriber
{
    public void MyEventHandler(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Handle the event
    }
}

MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
Subscriber subscriber = new Subscriber();

// Subscribe to the event
myObject.MyEvent += subscriber.MyEventHandler;

// Unsubscribe from the event
myObject.MyEvent -= subscriber.MyEventHandler;
```

### C#: verbatim strings

_Tags: #Csharp #strings_

The @ character causes escaped sequences to be interpreted literally (e.g.: `\\` for a backslash).

### ESLint

_Tags: #lint #eslint #guidelines_

The ESLint static code analysis tool allows to load specific style guides used by popular companies (Google, Airbnb, etc.), so we can write code following their guidelines.
