### Fluent interface pattern for call chaining

_Tags: #Patterns_

I recently implemented the fluent interface design pattern in quite a simple case to improve readability:

There was this class with some methods with no return value:

```csharp
internal class Class_A
{
    internal void Method1(string parameter)
    {
        _someObject.DoSomething(parameter);
    }

    internal void Method2(int parameter1, string parameter2)
    {
        parameter1.Execute();
        parameter2.DoSomethingElse();
    }
}
```

And that class was used by several other classes where these methods had to be called multiple times:

```csharp
internal class Class_B
{
    private Class_A _classA;

    internal void Method3()
    {
        _classA.Method1("some parameter");
        _classA.Method1("some other parameter");
        _classA.Method2(123, "another parameter");
        _classA.Method1("and one more");
    }
}
```

The calls to methods from Class_A were really a lot and they were one after the other. For context, this was a Selenium project where Class_A had methods to interact with the browser elements and Class_B was the one guiding that interaction, so methods from Class_A had to be called multiple times, one after the other.

The way the fluent interface pattern was implemented here was to make methods from Class_A return an object of the very same type:

```csharp
internal class Class_A
{
    internal Class_A Method1(string parameter)
    {
        _someObject.DoSomething(parameter);
        return this;
    }

    internal Class_A Method2(int parameter1, string parameter2)
    {
        parameter1.Execute();
        parameter2.DoSomethingElse();
        return this;
    }
}
```

This made Class_B more readable by allowing to chain method calls:

```csharp
internal class Class_B
{
    private Class_A _classA;

    internal void Method3()
    {
        _classA.Method1("some parameter");
            .Method1("some other parameter");
            .Method2(123, "another parameter");
            .Method1("and one more");
    }
}
```

### Nullable value types

_Tags: #Nullables_

C# has "value types" and "reference types".

Reference types are those made by classes and they're inherently nullable, since objects are references in nature and they can reference a null value. However, primitive types like int, double or bool can't hold a null value per se. The same thing happens to structs like DateTime, TimeSpan or Guid.

To allow a value type variable to hold the null value, a `?` is added in its declaration:

```csharp
DateTime? date = getFromDatabase(purchaseDate);
```

### Early return pattern

_Tags: #Patterns #Conditionals_

I always try to keep my nesting at a minimum, but sometimes I find legacy code that has been there for ages and nobody even knows who wrote it centuries ago, which could use a refactor. This was one of those cases and there was some complex logic like this:

```csharp
public void SomeMethodIFound()
{
    if (x != y && x != z)
    {
        // more code

        if (something)
        {
            try
            {
                // more code

                foreach (item in list)
                {
                    // more code
                }

            // more code
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                // handle exception
            }
        }
        else
        {
            try
            {
                // more code

                if (something)
                {
                    // more code
                }
                else
                {
                    // more code
                }

                // more code
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                // handle exception
            }
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Logs.Add("some important information");
    }
}
```

This was a very long method with lots of code and lots of nesting and complex logic. But I was able to reduce at least one nesting level by just inverting the if condition in the first line. So, instead of `if (x != y && x != z)` I changed it to `if (x == y || x == z)`, and added the body in the `else` block there, followed by a `return` statement (since that was the last line in the method):

```csharp
public void SomeMethodIFound()
{
    if (x == y || x == z)  // Condition is inverted
    {
        Logs.Add("some important information");  // This was the body in the 'else' block.
        return;  // I added this for an early return.
    }

    // And now, the rest of the code that was originally in the 'if' block, reducing one indentation level.

    // more code

    if (something)
    {
        try
        {
            // more code

            foreach (item in list)
            {
                // more code
            }

        // more code
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // handle exception
        }
    }
    else
    {
        try
        {
            // more code

            if (something)
            {
                // more code
            }
            else
            {
                // more code
            }

            // more code
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // handle exception
        }
    }
}
```

### Request validation in ASP.NET

_Tags: #ASP.NET #Validations #Escaping_

[Request validation in ASP.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/whitepapers/request-validation) prevents unencoded html from begin processed by the server. It means that validations will be executed before whatever controller is being called from the frontend.

### Escaping characters in the frontend vs the backend

_Tags: #Validations #Escaping_

Related to the previous entry, escaping characters in the frontend vs the backend (or in addition to the backend) probably is a good practise for whatever technology we're using. Example:

```javascript
function search(query)
    $.ajax({
    url: '@Url.Action("Search", "Home")',
        type: "POST",
        data: { text: encodeURIComponent(query) },
    //more code
    });
```

And then, in your `Search(text)` method from the `Home` controller you'll need to decode the text before using it:

```csharp
string decodedText = HttpUtility.HtmlDecode(text);
```

### Unescaped characters in logs

_Tags: #Debugging #Escaping_

If you need to search for a string in logs and the string has special characters (like accented letters): `2025-01-15 11:16:13.063 -03:00 [ERR] Error generando actualización`, keep in mind that you might not find an exact match because of unescaped characters, so in logs it might look like this:  `2025-01-15 11:16:13.063 -03:00 [ERR] Error generando actualizaciÃ³n`.

### NHibernate default maximum length for strings

_Tags: #NHibernate #Databases_

Even if you set a column in your database table to hold the maximum possible length for a varchar, if the NHibernate mapping doesn't explicitly set a length, the default max will be 4000 characters.

So it doesn't matter if you set your column to support the max length: `ALTER COLUMN Description varchar(max)`. If your mapping looks like this: `<property name="Description" />` it will be capped to 4000 chars.

### Casting to an IActionResult .NET object when asserting in tests

_Tags: #Endpoints #UnitTesting_

Let's say there's a simple controller like this:

```csharp
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public IActionResult GetUser(int id)
{
    var user = _userRepository.GetUserById(id);

    if (user == null)
    {
        return NotFound(new { Message = "User not found." });
    }

    return Ok(user);
}
```

When writing tests, we should cast returned objects to the proper ActionResult type, which represents some http status code that could be returned by the endpoint:

```csharp
var result = controller.GetUser(1) as NotFoundObjectResult;
Assert.That(result, Is.Not.Null);
```

And it's important to cast into the `NotFoundObjectResult` ActionResult (in this case). If the object returned by GetUser() wasn't cast into a specific ActionResult, asserting against null would mean that we're checking whether an ActionResult was returned, instead of asserting the specific type we want was returned.

One thing to notice is that the controller returns the results of calling `NotFound()`, which is a `NotFoundObjectResult`. And .NET has many of these helper methods, provided by `ControllerBase`, returning specific types of ActionResults objects. Here's a table with them, as a cheatsheet:

| ActionResult Type         | Helper Method         | HTTP Status Code | Description                                                                 |
