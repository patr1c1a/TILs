### Object creation in C++ vs. C\#

_Tags: #C++ #CSharp #OOP #Objects_

In **C++** there's just one type of class. You can declare classes either as `class` (_private_ by default) or `struct` (_public_ by default). Also, any class instance can be stored either in the stack or the heap.

**C#** has two different hierarchies or classes:

- Reference types: classes that directly inherit from `System.Object`. They are OO classes with all their features and are always allocated on the heap. They can be declared using the `class` keyword.
- Value types: classes that inherit from `System.ValueType` (which in turn inherits from `System.Object`). They represent data structures, with no inheritance, and can live both on stack or heap, but they cannot be directly allocated on the heap (only as a part of a reference type object). They can be declared using the `struct` keyword.

In C++ object are not initialized with default values, so they can contain old data leftovers from whatever was previously allocated in the same place in memory.

C# differs in this since it automatically creates a constructor that initializes all fields to their default values.

This C++ example first calls a function that instantiates `AnObject` that doesn't have an explicit constructor, and the function assigns a value to the object field. Then something else (an integer) is stored in the heap, and then the second method is called, which just prints whatever is left over in the memory position where the second object field is now stored. If we didn't have the `int*` variable in between, probably both functions would print 9876, since the second one will allocate the same memory position, where the first function had stored 9876. But adding something in between changes this and causes the second object.field to contain some random value.

```c++
#include <iostream>

struct AnObject {
    int field;  
};

void some_function() {
    AnObject object;
    object.field = 9876;
    std::cout << "object.field: " << object.field << std::endl;
}

void another_function() {
    AnObject object;
    std::cout << "object.field: " << object.field << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    some_function();
    int * somethingInHeap = new int(6);
    another_function();

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```code
object.field: 9876
object.field: 32622
```

If we did the same in C#, then we'd have a compiler error, since it won't allow accessing `object2.field` without initializing it first, since C# aims to be safe and won't allow using an uninitialized variable with a default value even when it assigns one:

```csharp
using System;

struct AnObject
{
    public int field;
}

public class Program
{
    public static void some_method()
    {
        AnObject object1;
        object1.field = 9876;
        Console.WriteLine($"object1.field: {object1.field}");
    }

    public static void another_method()
    {
        AnObject object2;
        Console.WriteLine($"object2.field: {object2.field}");
    }

    public static void Main()
    {
        some_method();
        Int32 n = 6;
        another_method();
    }
}
```

Output:

```code
main.cs(20,68): error CS0170: Use of possibly unassigned field `field'
Compilation failed: 1 error(s), 0 warnings
```

### Tightly coupled classes make unit testing cumbersome

_Tags: #UnitTesting #SOLID #MonkeyPatching #Python_

Let's say we have a class that has a method which creates an instance of some other class and does something with it. These classes are tightly coupled, since we cannot separate the object being created from the class that creates it. Example:

```python
class ASD:
    def do_something(self):
        return "something"

class QWE:
    def do_something_else(self):
        return ASD().do_something()

print(QWE().do_something())
```

The class QWE directly instantiates and depends on the class ASD within its method doSomething(), so any changes to ASD can directly impact QWE, making the code less maintainable and flexible.

This can be problematic since QWE is not only responsible for its own behavior but also for ASD's behavior (violation of the Single Responsibility principle).

Also, since QWE directly creates an instance of ASD, it cannot easily be configured to use a different implementation of ASD or to be tested with a mock or stub of ASD.

Python allows testing this with _monkey patching_, which is able to replace or modify the behavior of classes or functions at runtime. This way, we can isolate the behavior of QWE from the behavior of ASD, making it easier to test QWE in isolation. The `unittest.mock` module provides a `@patch` decorator for mocking, and by `mock_asd.return_value.do_something.return_value` we can specify what we need do_something to return when the mock object is used. This decorator automatically handles the cleanup of the patched objects after the test function completes execution, ensuring that the original state is restored properly.

```python
@patch('__main__.ASD', autospec=True)
def test_qwe_with_mock_asd(mock_asd):
    mock_asd.return_value.do_something.return_value = "mocked something"

    qwe_instance = QWE()
    result = qwe_instance.do_something_else()

    assert result == "mocked something"
```

### C#: regions

_Tags: #Csharp #regions_

Regions are useful to make custom collapsible code blocks. Everything that falls within the `region` directive will be collapsible.

```csharp
#region MyRegion

some code block

#EndRegion
```

### C#: verbatim strings for reserved keywords as parameter names

_Tags: #Csharp #strings_

C# allows using `@` (verbatim string) to name parameters as reserved keywords. So you can have a `method(string @string)` where the parameter's name is actually "string".
