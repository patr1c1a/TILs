# TILs
This repository is where I post my daily "TIL" ("Today I Learned"), as a personal way to track my learning path. It reflects an ongoing process, showcasing the incremental steps I take in expanding my knowledge and skills.

The entries also act as a "warning system" for myself. If there's a noticeable gap in entries, it serves as a red flag, reminding me to actively seek new knowledge and stay engaged in continuous learning.

## Structure

- Each month is captured in a dedicated Markdown file (e.g., `2024-03.md`).
- Daily entries are organized by date within each monthly file.
- Entries may include quick insights, commands, or concepts learned on that specific day.

The TIL entries here are intentionally brief and focus on the minimum information I learned each day. They are not exhaustive articles but rather quick notes highlighting key takeaways from my daily experiences.

## Contributions

Feel free to explore the repository to get a glimpse of my learning journey. The entries may be brief, but each one represents a step forward in my personal and professional development.

While this repository is primarily for personal use, contributions, suggestions, or discussions are always welcome. If you find something interesting or have insights to share, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
