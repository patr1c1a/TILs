### Using variables on REST Client extension for VS Code

_Tags: #VSCode #Endpoints #REST_

I love the simplicity of this extension when you just need to test a couple requests without leaving Visual Studio Code and without having to write curl commands all the time. It's no Postman, but it's a nice option that allows to keep a couple requests in a `.http` or `.rest` file and use them to validate behavior while working on a project.

```txt
### ðŸ”‘ Log in and get JWT token
POST {{ host }}auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin123!"
}


### ðŸŸ¢ Get a list of users
GET http://localhost:5111/api/users
Authorization: Bearer auth_token_here


### ðŸŸ¢ Get a specific user by id
GET http://localhost:5111/api/users/1
Authorization: Bearer auth_token_here


### ðŸŸ¢ Create a new user
POST http://localhost:5111/api/users
Content-Type: application/json
ent-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer auth_token_here

{
  "username": "TestUser",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "user123!",
}
```

The problem comes when you have to authenticate and end up having to copy and paste the token in all requests (replacing the "auth_token_here" text in each one of them). Luckily, the extension supports variables. You can use them as macros, for example to hold the base url. And you can also capture the token from the response and store it in a variable that can be used in other requests.

A variable is declared with `@` and then the name, like this: `@host = http://localhost:5111/api/`, and it's used surrounded by `{{ }}`, like this: `GET {{ host }}users`.

As for the token capture, you need to name the request and then use that name to get the token from the response body:

```txt
# @name login
POST {{ host }}auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "{{ user_email}}",
    "password": "{{ user_password }}"
}

### Get me
@auth_token = {{login.response.body.token}}
```

Make sure you use the correct field name here. If your response includes the token in a field with a different name other than just "token", that's what you need to use:

 `@access_token = {{login.response.body.name_of_token_field}}`

And then you just use it like any other variable:

```txt
GET {{ host }}users
Authorization: Bearer {{ auth_token }}
```

This was tested on REST Client version 0.25.1.

### NSubstitute to test required fields

_Tags: #UnitTesting #NSubstitute #Csharp_

When writing tests for a model class that has required fields, we might need to validate that an object without a required field cannot be created. So if we create an object with a missing required field it will not compile:

```csharp
public class User
{
    [Required(ErrorMessage = "The username is required.")]
    public required string Username { get; set; }

    public string? Email { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = "The password is required.")]
    public required string Password { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = "The national ID number is required.")]
    public required int NationalIDNumber { get; set; }
}
```

```csharp
[Test]
public void User_WithMissingPassword_FailsValidation()
{
  var user = new User
  {
      Username = "TestUser",
      Email = "valid@example.com"
      NationalIDNumber = 1234;
  };

  var validationResults = new List<ValidationResult>();
  var validationContext = new ValidationContext(model, null, null);
  Validator.TryValidateObject(model, validationContext, validationResults, true);

  Assert.That(validationResults, Has.Count.EqualTo(1), "Validation should fail for missing password.");
  Assert.That(validationResults[0].ErrorMessage, Is.EqualTo("The password is required."));
}
```

This will probably trigger an error: `Required member 'User.Password' must be set in the object initializer or attribute constructor.` because we can't initialize a User object missing a required field.

One potential solution would be to use NSubstitute:

```csharp
[Test]
public void User_WithMissingPassword_FailsValidation()
{
  var user = Substitute.For<User>();
  user.Username = "TestUser";
  user.Email = "valid@email.com";
  user.NationalIDNumber = 1234;

  var validationResults = new List<ValidationResult>();
  var validationContext = new ValidationContext(model, null, null);
  Validator.TryValidateObject(model, validationContext, validationResults, true);

  Assert.That(validationResults, Has.Count.EqualTo(1), "Validation should fail for missing password.");
  Assert.That(validationResults[0].ErrorMessage, Is.EqualTo("The password is required."));
}
```

And this will work, and same thing goes for the `UserName` field. But the minute we try to do the same with `NationalIDNumber` it will fail (that is: no validation error will be triggered). And that is because Username and Password are reference types (string) and default to null, triggering the validation error. But `NationalIDNumber` is a value type (int) and defaults to 0, which does not trigger the validation error.
