### Using variables on REST Client extension for VS Code

_Tags: #VSCode_

I love the simplicity of this extension when you just need to test a couple simple requests but don't want to write curl commands all the time. It's no Postman, but for just a few simple tests it's a nice option, where you can keep all your requests together in a `.http` or `.rest` file with something like this.

```txt
### ðŸ”‘ Log in and get JWT token
POST {{ host }}auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin123!"
}


### ðŸŸ¢ Get a list of users
GET http://localhost:5111/api/users
Authorization: Bearer auth_token_here


### ðŸŸ¢ Get a specific user by id
GET http://localhost:5111/api/users/1
Authorization: Bearer auth_token_here


### ðŸŸ¢ Create a new user
POST http://localhost:5111/api/users
Content-Type: application/json
ent-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer auth_token_here

{
  "username": "TestUser",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "user123!",
}
```

The problem comes when you have to authenticate and end up having to copy and paste the token in all requests (replacing the "auth_token_here" text in each one of them). Luckily, the extension supports variables. You can use them as macros, for example to hold the base url. And you can also capture the token from the response and store it in a variable that can be used in other requests.

A variable is declared with `@` and then the name, like this: `@host = http://localhost:5111/api/`, and it's used surrounded by `{{ }}`, like this: `GET {{ host }}users`.

As for the token capture, you need to name the request and then use that name to get the token from the response body:

```txt
# @name login
POST {{ host }}auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "{{ user_email}}",
    "password": "{{ user_password }}"
}

### Get me
@auth_token = {{login.response.body.token}}
```

Make sure you use the correct field name here. If your response includes the token in a field with a different name other than just "token", that's what you need to use:

 `@access_token = {{login.response.body.name_of_token_field}}`

And then you just use it like any other variable:

```txt
GET {{ host }}users
Authorization: Bearer {{ auth_token }}
```

This was tested on REST Client version 0.25.1.
