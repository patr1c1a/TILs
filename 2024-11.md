### Underscore as a placeholder variable to improve readability

_Tags: #Variables_

When you need to call a method that returns something but you don't really care about that something, you can just call the method without assigning its value to any variables. But, for better readability and understanding of the code, we can use `_` instead of a variable declaration. In doing this, the code clearly shows that this method does return a value, but the value is actually discarded.

### Avoid "new" so class can be tested in isolation

_Tags: #UnitTesting #DependencyInjection_

I already added an entry (on 9th April) related to this and how Python deals with this issue, but I wanted to document this case where I found a similar problem in C# while working on some unit tests with NUnit and NSubstitute. And the case I ran into was a bit crooked, so it made it more interesting to learn from it.

I was writing unit tests for a class, let's call it "Class_A". This class used an object from "Class_B", which in turn dealt with some objects from Azure Table Storage, and its connection string was stored in the `AppConfig` file, accessed by a using an `AppConfigFactory`. The constructor for Class_B had this code (I'm leaving out some parts that aren't relevant here):

```csharp
AppConfig appConfig = AppConfigFactory.GetAppConfig();
string connectionString = _appConfig.GetAppSetting("AzureTableStorageConnectionString");
TableClient tableClient = new TableClient(connectionString, "TableName");
```

The behavior I wanted to test was that one of the methods in Class_A did something specific if a particular value was found in the Table Storage handled by Class_B. Let's call that method "ReturnTranslation", so Class_A had something like this (again, I'm ignoring other parts and including only the relevant parts):

```csharp
public string Translate(string text)
{
    string translation = _classB.RetrieveFromStorage(text);
    if (translation != null)
        return translation;
    // some more code
}
```

This particular test I was writing intended to validate that method `Translate` in Class_A was actually returning the translation if Class_B was able to retrieve it from the storage. So I mocked Class_B and needed to intercept the way it interacted with the storage, by setting a hardcoded return value that I could assert against in my test (I basically needed to tell it "when RetrieveFromStorage() from Class_B is called, return 'translated text'"). This means I needed to mock some of Class_B's objects as well. So, in addition to Class_B's mock, I mocked `AppConfigFactory` and instructed it to return the hardcoded "some connection string" when I called `GetAppSetting("AzureTableStorageConnectionString")`:

```csharp
var appConfigMock = Substitute.For<AppConfig>();
appConfigMock.GetAppSetting("AzureTableStorageConnectionString").Returns("some connection string");
```

This way, I was expecting to be able to write a test similar to this:

```csharp
public void Translate_TranslationFoundInStorage_ReturnsTranslatedText()
{
    // Creating mocks and setting return values
    var appConfigMock = Substitute.For<AppConfig>();
    appConfigMock.GetAppSetting("AzureTableStorageConnectionString").Returns("some connection string");    
    
    var classBMock = Substitute.For<Class_B>();
    classBMock.RetrieveFromStorage(Arg.Any<string>()).Returns("translated text");

    // The method Translate() from Class_A is the method under test
    var classA = new Class_A();
    string translatedText = classA.Translate("text");

    Assert.AreEqual("translated text", translatedText);
}
```

The thing is, when running the test I was getting an error about "some connection string" not being a valid connection string, even when I was using a mocked Class_B object. The problem was that Class_B's constructor was instantiating an actual TableClient (with the `new` instruction). Even creating a TableClient substitute wouldn't solve the problem, because there was no way to instruct Class_B to use the mock.

The solution in this case was to implement dependency injection, adding TableClient as a parameter to Class_B's constructor:

```csharp
public Class_B(TableClient tableClient)
{
    AppConfig appConfig = AppConfigFactory.GetAppConfig();
    string connectionString = _appConfig.GetAppSetting("AzureTableStorageConnectionString");
    TableClient tableClient = tableClient;
}
```

Now I can use a mocked TableClient and inject it to Class_B so it doesn't try to connect to the actual Table Storage every time the test runs.
