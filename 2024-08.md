### Unit test naming conventions

_Tags: #UnitTesting_

Following conventions is usually a good thing, so naming unit tests is not an exception. There are a couple strategies, each with its pros and cons. The team I currently work on follows Roy Osherove's: `[UnitOfWork]_[StateUnderTest]_[ExpectedBehavior]`, where the "unit of work" is usually a method name, but it could also be something else (like a class). An example could be: `SendRequest_MissingAuthorizationHeader_ThrowsUnauthorizedException` (which could be understood as "when SendRequest method is executed and it's missing an Authorization header, it will throw an exception indicating we're unauthorized").

This is not the only way of naming tests, with some people using alternatives as `Should_[ExpectedBehavior_When_[StateUnderTest]`, where words "Should" and "When" are included in the name. An example of this could be: `Should_ThrowUnauthorizedExeption_When_MissingAuthorizationHeader`, or the similar one `When_[StateUnderTest]_Expect_[ExpectedBehavior]`.
