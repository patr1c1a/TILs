### MS SQL Server transactions

_Tags: #SQLServer_

In **SQL Server Management Studio**, if working on a query that might cause unwanted effects, it can be done within a transaction by typing "begin transaction" in the query file, then selecting this text and executing query. Then the actual query can be executed and, if anything wasn't as expected the transaction can be rolled back by typing and executing "rollback". If it was successful, then we can type and execute "commit".

### Debugging

_Tags: #Debugging_

When debugging something that looks a bit tricky, a good starting point might be to go throught the call stack adding a breakpoint in every single step, before running the code again. Then remove whatever steps seem to be not playing a part in the bug. This could be an alternative to just going through the code while exploring the references to each object.

### Breakpoint conditions

_Tags: #Debugging_

In Visual Studio (and some other IDEs) there's a feature that allows adding a condition to a breakpoint. So execution will only stop if the given condition is true. For Visual Studio this is done by right-clicking on a breakpoint and selecting "conditions".

### Debugging locally

_Tags: #Debugging #Environment_

Maybe this doesn't apply to every project because it depends on how the team manages their environments, but if something "works on my machine" but then errors show up in a test/dev environment, it might be a good idea to point the local environment to the database the test environment uses and then debug the code from that. If the code runs in a way locally but then a different thing happens when running in a different environment, there's a chance that the database has some wrong data. So using the local code with the test database might help unveil the bug.
