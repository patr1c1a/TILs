### DTOs for better debugging

_Tags: #Debugging #CSharp #DTOs_

A DTO (Data Transfer Object) might sound like an overkill when the object only has a few properties, like in this example for a request (taken from [OpenAI docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)):

```csharp
var request = new
    {
        model = "gpt-4o",
        messages = new[]
            {
                new { role = "system", content = "You are a helpful assistant." },
                new { role = "user", content = "Hello!" }
            },
            temperature = 0.1
    };
```

But this could end up being a bit harder to debug, since it will be read as a whole line with one instruction. So any potential bugs hidden in this object might get overlooked.

To make it easier to debug, we first will have to create classes for each object, like this:

```csharp
internal class DTORequest
{
    public string Model { get; set; }
    public List<Message> Messages { get; set; }
    public double Temperature { get; set; }
}

internal class Message
{
    public string Role { get; set; }
    public string Content { get; set; }
}
```

And whenever we need to create a request object

```csharp
var request = new DTORequest();
request.Model = "gpt-4o";
request.Temperature = 0.1;
            
request.Messages = new List<Message>();

var systemMessage = new Message();
systemMessage.Role = "system";
systemMessage.Content = "You are a helpful assistant.";
request.Messages.Add(systemMessage);

var userMessage = new Message();
userMessage.Role = "user";
userMessage.Content = "Hello!";
request.Messages.Add(userMessage);
```

Then we can proceed to use this however we need it, for example to create a json object that can be sent in a request to some endpoint:

```csharp
string body = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(request);
var data = new StringContent(body, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
```

### DTO mapping property to custom name

_Tags: #CSharp #DTOs #Json #Newtonsoft #Serialization_

Following up with the previous entry about the benefits of creating DTOs, this one will be about giving your properties custom names to better control JSON serialization.

This can be done using the Newtonsoft library, by adding the `JsonProperty` attribute to your DTO properties and specifying the exact JSON property name that should map to the DTO property. So, for the example in the previous entry we could do it like this:

```csharp
[JsonProperty("model")]
public string Model { get; set; }
        
[JsonProperty("messages")]
public List<Message> Messages { get; set; }

[JsonProperty("temperature")]
public double Temperature { get; set; }
```

In this case I only wanted a minor change: "Model" (with an upper case "M") should map to "model" with lower case "m". But you can definitely set a different property name.

Just don't forget you need to be `using Newtonsoft.Json` for this to work.

### Test case parameters

_Tags: #UnitTesting #NUnit_

Using parameters to run a test multiple times with different test data is quite easy. So let's assume we have a test like this, which is supposedly testing a method called `Capitalize()` from some `Capitalizer` class, which should receive some text and, if empty, return the same text, unmodified:

```Csharp
[Test]
public void Capitalize_EmptyText_ReturnsUnmodifiedText()
{
    var capitalizer = new Capitalizer();
    string text = "  ";
    string returnValue = capitalizer.Capitalize(text);
    Assert.AreEqual(text, returnValue);
}
```

But of course "empty" text could mean a series of things: it could be an empty string, a string containing just whitespace, or even null. So, in order to run the same test with all these options, NUnit provides the `[TestCase]` attribute, where the argument is the test data being used and will be passed to the test case method, which will get it in its parameter(s):

```Csharp
[TestCase("")]
[TestCase(" ")]
[TestCase(null)]
public void Capitalize_EmptyText_ReturnsUnmodifiedText(string text)
{
    var capitalizer = new Capitalizer();
    string returnValue = capitalizer.Capitalize(text);
    Assert.AreEqual(text, returnValue);
}
```

Notice how the `text` variable was replaced with a parameter, and also the `[Test]` attribute is now not necessary, since it's implied from `[TestCase]`.

### Test case mocks (or substitutes) might be necessary even when it doesn't look like it

_Tags: #UnitTesting #Nunit_

Let's assume the following scenario: a class under test, where the constructor initializes some other objects (for example: a logger, a class to manage configurations, a DAO, etc.). These objects will definitely need to be mocked for unit testing, so we'll use NSubstitute for it. And there's this particular scenario we want to test, that makes no use of those aditional objects. For the sake of practicity, let's say our method under test does something very simple, like validating if a parameter is null:

```csharp
if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(parameter))
    return parameter;
```

So we want to build a test that validates this scenario (when `parameter==null`, then `parameter` is returned), so we proceed to write the same test I used in the previous entry (where `Capitalizer` is the class under test and `Capitalize()` is the method being tested):

```csharp
[TestCase("")]
[TestCase(" ")]
[TestCase(null)]
public void Capitalize_EmptyText_ReturnsUnmodifiedText(string text)
{
    var capitalizer = new Capitalizer();
    string returnValue = capitalizer.Capitalize(text);
    Assert.AreEqual(text, returnValue);
}
```

This will run normally and pass. But the problem here is that the constructor is still being called (by `new Capitalizer()`) and we said the constructor instantiated all kinds of objects. So in this test case we're still using actual objects, that might access actual files or actual databases. And we can verify this by debugging the test and checking if our objects are actual objects or `Substitutes`.

So this is just a reminder that even when it doesn't look like anything needs mocking because the test is not directly using aditional objects, mocking might still be necessary.

### Asserting exception is thrown

_Tags: #UnitTesting #Exceptions_

Let's assume we're testing a class called `Translator` and particularly a method called `TranslateIntoSpanish` in it. The method under test does something (in this case, English-Spanish translation), catches any exception that might occur, logs the error and re-throws the exception. This is a simplified example in which the method uses some translation service from an API client that will translate English text into a target language:

```csharp
public string TranslateIntoSpanish(string text)
{
    try
    {
        string translatedText = _translationAPIClient.Translate(text, "Spanish");
        return translatedText;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, ex.Message);
        throw;
    }
}
```

In this example we also assume `_translationAPIClient` and `_logger` are private fields in the class under test, and they're being initialized correctly in the constructor.

I now want to write a test for this that verifies the exception is both logged and thrown. My test class contains a private class for mocking objects, so that's where I have my `TranslationAPIClient` mock object set and configured. Then I could write a test that verifies an exception is caught/thrown and logged whenever the mocked `TranslationAPIClient` itself throws an exception.

```csharp
public void TranslateIntoSpanish_ErrorOnTranslationAPIClient_LogsAndThrowsException()
{
    var mocks = new Mocks();
    mocks.TranslationAPIClient.Translate(Arg.Any<string>(), Arg.Any<string>()).Throws<Exception>();

    var translator = new Translator();

    var ex = Assert.Throws<Exception>(() => translator.Translate("text"));
    mocks.Logger.Received(1).LogError(ex, ex.Message);
}
```

This is ok and it works. Let's see exactly what it does:

- It first creates an instance of the private Mocks class, used for mocking objects. Remember the class will already have a substitute (using NSubstitute) for `TranslationAPIClient` and also for the `Logger`, so we isolate the behavior of the `Translator` class under test without instantiating actual objects that this class uses.
- Next, the `TranslationAPIClient` mock is configured so whenever the Translate method is called with any string arguments, it throws a generic Exception.
- Now the `Translator` class under test is instantiated.
- The next instruction asserts that a generic Exception is thrown whenever the `Translate` method is called on the `Translator` object, and also stores that exception.
- Finally, we check the `Logger` object has received a call to log the exception thrown in the previous step, as well as its message.

This is setting up the mock to throw an exception of type Exception directly, without creating a specific instance of it: `Throws<Exception>()`. Then we check for an exception of type Exception to be thrown and have no control over its message. So an alternative would be to do this instead:

```csharp
public void TranslateIntoSpanish_ErrorOnTranslationAPIClient_LogsAndThrowsException()
{
    var exception = new Exception("error message");
    
    var mocks = new Mocks();
    mocks.TranslationAPIClient.Translate(Arg.Any<string>(), Arg.Any<string>()).Throws(exception);

    var translator = new Translator();

    Assert.Throws<Exception>(() => translator.Translate("text"));
    mocks.Logger.Received(1).LogError(exception, exception.Message);
}
```

In this case we first instantiate an exception of type Exception and set our custom error message. Then we tell the mocked object to throw this specific exception whenever the `Translate` method is called. Thus, we don't need to store the returned exception because we already have it on our first line. Finally, the logger should be logging this particular exception with the message we already set up.
