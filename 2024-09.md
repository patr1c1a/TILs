### DTOs for better debugging

_Tags: #Debugging #CSharp #DTOs_

A DTO (Data Transfer Object) might sound like an overkill when the object only has a few properties, like in this example for a request (taken from [OpenAI docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)):

```csharp
var request = new
    {
        model = "gpt-4o",
        messages = new[]
            {
                new { role = "system", content = "You are a helpful assistant." },
                new { role = "user", content = "Hello!" }
            },
            temperature = 0.1
    };
```

But this could end up being a bit harder to debug, since it will be read as a whole line with one instruction. So any potential bugs hidden in this object might get overlooked.

To make it easier to debug, we first will have to create classes for each object, like this:

```csharp
internal class DTORequest
{
    public string Model { get; set; }
    public List<Message> Messages { get; set; }
    public double Temperature { get; set; }
}

internal class Message
{
    public string Role { get; set; }
    public string Content { get; set; }
}
```

And whenever we need to create a request object

```csharp
var request = new DTORequest();
request.Model = "gpt-4o";
request.Temperature = 0.1;
            
request.Messages = new List<Message>();

var systemMessage = new Message();
systemMessage.Role = "system";
systemMessage.Content = "You are a helpful assistant.";
request.Messages.Add(systemMessage);

var userMessage = new Message();
userMessage.Role = "user";
userMessage.Content = "Hello!";
request.Messages.Add(userMessage);
```

Then we can proceed to use this however we need it, for example to create a json object that can be sent in a request to some endpoint:

```csharp
string body = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(request);
var data = new StringContent(body, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
```

### DTO mapping property to custom name

_Tags: #CSharp #DTOs #Json #Newtonsoft #Serialization_

Following up with the previous entry about the benefits of creating DTOs, this one will be about giving your properties custom names to better control JSON serialization.

This can be done using the Newtonsoft library, by adding the `JsonProperty` attribute to your DTO properties and specifying the exact JSON property name that should map to the DTO property. So, for the example in the previous entry we could do it like this:

```csharp
[JsonProperty("model")]
public string Model { get; set; }
        
[JsonProperty("messages")]
public List<Message> Messages { get; set; }

[JsonProperty("temperature")]
public double Temperature { get; set; }
```

In this case I only wanted a minor change: "Model" (with an upper case "M") should map to "model" with lower case "m". But you can definitely set a different property name.

Just don't forget you need to be `using Newtonsoft.Json` for this to work.

### Test case parameters

_Tags: #UnitTesting #NUnit_

Using parameters to run a test multiple times with different test data is quite easy. So let's assume we have a test like this, which is supposedly testing a method called `Capitalize()` from some `Capitalizer` class, which should receive some text and, if empty, return the same text, unmodified:

```Csharp
[Test]
public void Capitalize_EmptyText_ReturnsUnmodifiedText()
{
    var capitalizer = new Capitalizer();
    string text = "  ";
    string returnValue = capitalizer.Capitalize(text);
    Assert.AreEqual(text, returnValue);
}
```

But of course "empty" text could mean a series of things: it could be an empty string, a string containing just whitespace, or even null. So, in order to run the same test with all these options, NUnit provides the `[TestCase]` attribute, where the argument is the test data being used and will be passed to the test case method, which will get it in its parameter(s):

```Csharp
[TestCase("")]
[TestCase(" ")]
[TestCase(null)]
public void Capitalize_EmptyText_ReturnsUnmodifiedText(string text)
{
    var capitalizer = new Capitalizer();
    string returnValue = capitalizer.Capitalize(text);
    Assert.AreEqual(text, returnValue);
}
```

Notice how the `text` variable was replaced with a parameter, and also the `[Test]` attribute is now not necessary, since it's implied from `[TestCase]`.

### Test case mocks (or substitutes) might be necessary even when it doesn't look like it

_Tags: #UnitTesting #Nunit_

Let's assume the following scenario: a class under test, where the constructor initializes some other objects (for example: a logger, a class to manage configurations, a DAO, etc.). These objects will definitely need to be mocked for unit testing, so we'll use NSubstitute for it. And there's this particular scenario we want to test, that makes no use of those aditional objects. For the sake of practicity, let's say our method under test does something very simple, like validating if a parameter is null:

```csharp
if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(parameter))
    return parameter;
```

So we want to build a test that validates this scenario (when `parameter==null`, then `parameter` is returned), so we proceed to write the same test I used in the previous entry (where `Capitalizer` is the class under test and `Capitalize()` is the method being tested):

```csharp
[TestCase("")]
[TestCase(" ")]
[TestCase(null)]
public void Capitalize_EmptyText_ReturnsUnmodifiedText(string text)
{
    var capitalizer = new Capitalizer();
    string returnValue = capitalizer.Capitalize(text);
    Assert.AreEqual(text, returnValue);
}
```

This will run normally and pass. But the problem here is that the constructor is still being called (by `new Capitalizer()`) and we said the constructor instantiated all kinds of objects. So in this test case we're still using actual objects, that might access actual files or actual databases. And we can verify this by debugging the test and checking if our objects are actual objects or `Substitutes`.

So this is just a reminder that even when it doesn't look like you need to mock anything because the test is not directly using aditional objects, mocking might still be necessary.
