### Selenium with Powershell

_Tags: #Selenium #Powershell #Automation_

Selenium can be integrated with Powershell to write automation scripts. You just need to install it using `Install-Module -Name Selenium`. After that, you might need to change permissions to be able to run the script, by doing `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` or, as a one-time operation bypassing permission policies for the current execution of the script: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File script.ps1`.
Then you can configure where to find the Chrome webdriver (if Chrome is being used) and the Chrome browser like this:

```ps1
$chromeDriverPath = "C:\Selenium\"
$chromeBinaryPath = "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
```

And use these values when creating the webdriver object:

```ps1
$options = New-Object OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome.ChromeOptions
$options.BinaryLocation = $chromeBinaryPath
$driver = New-Object OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome.ChromeDriver($chromeDriverPath, $options)
```

Chrome webdriver can be found at [https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/).

### Have Selenium run in an existing Chrome browser window

_Tags: #Selenium #Automation #Chrome_

I tested this both in PowerShell and C#. I know it can be done with other languages as well but it's not something I tried myself. It requires Chrome to run with remote debugging enabled (which could pose security risks): `chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222` so Selenium can interact with the existing Chrome window.

For C# it just needs the debugger address to be added to ChromeOptions:

```csharp
var options = new ChromeOptions();
options.DebuggerAddress = "localhost:9222";
IWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);
```

### App.config configSections

_Tags: #App.config_

You can just toss your configuration key-value pairs in the  `App.config` file within the `<configuration> <appSettings>` tags. But, if for some reason the keys needs to be organized into sections, it can be done by adding `<configSections>` as a tag inside `<configuration>` (`<appSettings>` will be omitted) and then using those sections to organize keys:

```xml
<configuration>
    <configSections>
        <section name="section1" type="System.Configuration.NameValueSectionHandler"/>
        <section name="section2" type="System.Configuration.NameValueSectionHandler"/>
    </configSections>
    <section1>
        <add key="first" value="10" />
        <add key="second" value="100" />
    </section1>
    <section2>
        <add key="third" value="50" />
    </section2>
</configuration>
```
