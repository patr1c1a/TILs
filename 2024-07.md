### Quick local server

_Tags: #Python #Localhost_

Python allows to quickly run a local server to make files in the current directory available on localhost:8000. All it needs (other than having Python installed) is to go to the desired directory, e.g.:

`cd C:/Users/Patricia/Desktop`

And then start a simple local HTTP server:

`python -m http.server 8000`

which will serve files from the current directory at `http://localhost:8000`.

Now, what was my exact use case for this: I was trying to change an image in a published website (I didn't have its source code), just to see what it would look like. So I opened the website on my browser, opened dev tools and inspected that particular image. Then I changed the `src` attribute value to my image url at `http://localhost:8000/myimage.png`. This was the easiest way I found to achieve what I wanted, since the browser security features wouldn't allow loading the image from my local disk, so `file:///C:/Users/Patricia/Desktop/myimage.png` didn't work.
